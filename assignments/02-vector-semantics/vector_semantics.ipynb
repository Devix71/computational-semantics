    "## 5. Semantic composition and phrase similarity **[20 marks]**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this task, we are going to look at how different semantic composition models, introduced in [2] correlate with human judgements. The file with the dataset `mitchell_lapata_acl08.txt` is included with this notebook (we also used it in the class).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation of the task from Discord channel:\n",
    "\n",
    "**What are we trying to achieve?**  \n",
    "We want to create models, which can automatically capture differences between meaning of different phrases. These models should also be as good as we are (humans) in this task. Check example (1) from Mitchell/Lapata paper, it has two sentences which share the same words, but their meaning is completely different. We as humans can clearly see this difference, but how could a machine capture it?\n",
    "\n",
    "It is intuitive that in order to get a meaning of a phrase, we might combine meaning of individual words in this phrase somehow, but how? First, we represent each word with the frequency vector based on the semantic space that we built before (e.g, frequency space, ppmi space, svd space). In other words, each word's meaning is represented by the number of times other words occur in the context, defined by window size. Now, we have a vector for `discussion` and a vector for `thrive`.\n",
    "\n",
    "_How do we combine these vectors to get a single vector for the phrase `discussion thrive`?_\n",
    "\n",
    "Such methods of combining meaning vectors into a single item are called _semantic composition methods_ (literally, because we compose semantic meaning of the phrase from its individuals). During the lecture, we tried different semantic composition methods: additive, multiplicative, combined.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we multiplied the vectors (went with the multiplicative method) and now we have one vector for our phrase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, we want to have a model that captures differences between the phrases; it means that if `discussion thrive` is our reference phrase, we need to have a different phrase (high or low similarity phrase) to compare it against the reference one. How do we get this other phrase? Well, this other phrase can be either very similar to the reference or not similar at all, right? Let's say we decided to go with the second option and made/constructed a phrase `discussion digress`, which we know is very dissimilar to the reference phrase. We label this pair of phrases as having a low similarity, e.g., `low` in `hilo`. We can also create a different phrase (e.g., `discussion develop`) and use it as a high similarity phrase when paired with our reference phrase, right? This then would be labeled as `high` in `hilo`. This is what `hilo` in the dataset stands for: known information about how similar the reference phrase and the landmark phrase are.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, our main task is to automatically learn the similarities/differences between our reference and our landmark, right? We take the first pair: `discussion thrive` vs. `discussion digress`. We have a vector representation for each of these phrases.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How do we compare two vectors?**\n",
    "\n",
    "We use cosine similarity to calculate a single score that would tell us about the similarity between these two vectors. The bigger the cosine, the more similar two vectors are. Cosine ranges from 0 to 1 (0 is very low similarity, 1 is very high similarity). Let's say, we get a cosine of 0.89, it means that according to the multiplicative model (remember, we decided to use multiplicative semantic composition method), these phrases are very similar (cosine is quite high). But wait a second, we know that these two phrases should be of low similarity, right? Because this is what the value in `hilo` tells us about this pair - `discussion thrive` and `discussion digress` are not similar to each other. Clearly, our multiplicative method fails to capture it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What can we do to improve our model?**\n",
    "\n",
    "We can try a different composition method to get a phrase vector from phrase's words: let's replace multiplication with addition. Or we can also use combined method. Let's say we used combined method and run cosine again; this time it tells that the cosine score is 0.45. Ok, this seems to be quite low, and it also agrees with our knowledge that these phrases are indeed not similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, we need to evaluate different composition models (additive, multiplicative, combined) and analyse how well they perform. **How do we analyse their performance?** Because we have the ground-truth for comparison (`hilo` values), we know whether our phrases are actually similar or not. We want our cosine score to reflect this knowledge: if the score is high, but the groun-truth hilo is low, then we have a problem in the model - it did not learn things well, we need to replace the composition function.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "_Long story short_: `hilo` is something that we compare our cosine to. `hilo` contains correct answers about similarity between phrases, and cosine should agree with this. If reference-landmark pair are `high` in `hilo`, then cosine should be high enough to reflect that. If cosine is not high in this case, then we look at our model and change the composition function. We need to find the function, which give us cosines that are super close to the ground-truth known `hilo` values."

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "In `High` and `Low` columns we have mean cosine values.\n",
    "These are calculated by averaging cosine scores for all pairs of phrases per model.\n",
    "Rows introduce different models: `add` is additive, `multiply` is multiplicative, etc. (these are all described in the paper). `NonComp` is a baseline model, the most \"stupid\" one, it should be the worst. `UpperBound` is how humans performed in this task (they were asked to rate similarity between pairs of phrases, 1 is the lowest, 7 is the highest). Why these numbers are in a different scale, not from 0 to 1 like cosine, but from 1 to 7? Because they are not normalised, and authors explicitly said that they are interested in relative differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need models which are closer to human ratings. `Add` model has 0.59 mean for `High` and 0.59 for `Low`, so it did not learn to differentiate between high similarity pairs and low similarity ones. This is a bad model then, we need a better one. `WeightAdd` seems to be doing better, the difference between `High` and `Low` is now 0.01, but it's also quite bad - the difference is not that obvious. The best models are `Multiply` and `Combined`, because their mean cosines for `High` and `Low` are quite different from each other. We can see that these two models gave higher cosines for high similarity pairs (0.42 and 0.38), while giving lower cosines for low similarity pairs (0.28 and 0.28). And this is a good result - it shows that these two composition functions are so far the best in (i) giving high cosine go highly similar pairs and low cosine to very dissimilar pairs, and (ii) keeping the distance (range) between high and low cosines quite large.\n",
    "\n",
    "**However, we can't say how far/close they are when compared to human performance (UpperBound) since human scores are not normalised.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Still, we want to choose a model which is the closest to humans. This is why we want to run **the correlation test.**\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we perform the correlation test? We need to see how well *each model* correlates with human judgements. So for each model, we would have a vector of cosine values this model gives for each pair that we have. For example, let's say we have three pairs of phrases and our cosine values from additive model are the following ones: `[0.89, 0.40, 0.70]`. Now we need to get a vector of the same size, but for human scores. What do we have for human scores? We have multiple participants, which means that a single phrase can be evaluated by multiple participants. Let's say, the first phrase has scores from two participants (`6, 7`), so what we would do is that we would average it to have a single number (`(6 + 7) / 2 = 6.5`). With this, we can get a mean vector of human scores per item: `[6.5, 3, 6]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we have two vectors and we can run Spearman correlation on these vectors. This is what exactly what the third column in the Results table is showing (the correlation value). There is also a p-value (denoted right below the table)."

Try to keep information about human rating (`input`) and high/low similarity (`hilo`), because you will need it for correlation tests.

It's up to you, but a dictionary-like format could be a good choice.\n",

    "(ii) Build models of semantic phrase composition: in the lecture we introduced simple additive, simple multiplicative and combined models (details are in [2]). Your task is to take a single pair of phrases, and compute the composition of its vectors using each of these functions. Thus, you will have (at least) three compositional models that take each `noun - verb` phrase from the pair (these phrases can be either references or landmarks) and output a single vector, representing the meaning of this phrase. As your semantic space, you can use pretrained spaces (standard space, ppmi or svd) introduced above. It is up to you which space you use, but for someone who runs your code, it should be pretty straightforward to switch between them.\n",
