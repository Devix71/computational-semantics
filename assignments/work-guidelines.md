### General information

- Keep an eye on the course repository, it will be populated with new assignments once they are released.
- You are free to choose *how* you are going to work on the assignment as a group. Just make sure that (i) course organisers could access your work, (ii) you can produce a final `.ipynb` file that you can submit to the Canvas course webpage. Below you will find our recommendation guidelines that have proven to be working based on experience from previous courses. We suggest that you follow them.
- You are going to submit assignments in groups. Join a group among the available ones by navigating to People -> Groups on the course page. You can choose the name of your group if you want to.

### TODO: before each session on the assignment

One and a half hours for a class might sound like a long time, but it normally goes very quickly, especially if we would like every group to be heard. Therefore, to optimise a discussion:

- Before the class, and in addition to submitting the preliminary solution to the assignment, each group should post their questions in the corresponding thread in Discussions on Canvas's course page. There will be a discussion thread for each assignment.
- We encourage you to describe the errors that you encounter and propose solutions. Do not be afraid to tell us about your ideas!
- TAs will read your posts before the class (and you should read them too) and try to structure them to topics around which we can focus our discussion later, starting from the group who made that comment.

### Working in a group / Submitting assignments

- Download the assignment folder, e.g. `01-logic-and-lambda-calculus`.
- The assignments are released as `.ipynb` files, e.g. Jupyter notebooks. Sometimes the folder also has other files such as `utils.py`, please don't remove them.
- Work on the assignment by modifying the notebook. Edit the code, put Markdown text where required (e.g., describe difficulties encountered).
  - Jupyter cells could be of four types: `-`, `Code`, `Markdown`, `Raw`. To change the cell type from `Code` to `Markdown`, click on the cell type (Jupyter bar above the notebook, next to the shortcut icons) and choose the type. Cells with code should have `Code` type, cells with comments and text should be of `Markdown` type.
- Name the file so that TAs could identify which group's submission it is, e.g. `assignment-01-group-A.ipynb`.
- If you have multiple files to upload (for example, you changed something in `utils.py`), put all files in a single `.zip` file and submit this zipped file.
- Submit the modified `.ipynb` to the assignment submission page on Canvas. The submission is done by *one* person from each group.

*Important note*: please upload your group's `.ipynb` file by the morning of the day when we have a class on this assignment. It would be nice for TAs (Adam, Nikolai) to look at your work-in-progress before the actual class on this assignment. To do this, simply upload your current state of the submission to the Canvas assignment page. You have an unlimited number of submissions before the actual submission deadline. It means that you could re-upload a new version after the class on the assignment with updated results.

### Grading

We will grade and comment on the file version that you uploaded last to the Canvas assignment's page.

For any questions, please contact us through Discord or e-mail.

## Organising your workspace

#### For every student

1. Make sure you have installed Jupyter. You can use either Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook - the former is a new version of the latter, using either of them is not really affecting the submission infrastructure. To install Jupyter, please have a look [here](https://jupyter.org/install).
2. You also might want to set up a GitHub account if you don't have one yet. If you don't have `git`, install it on your system (https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git). Sign up for GitHub (https://github.com/). Setup your terminal acceess with ssh-key from your local computer to your Github account (https://github.com/settings/keys).

#### For every group

1. At least one person in each group should fork course repository. Forks are public, so any other group member can see them too.
2. Once you have submitted an assignment solution on Canvas, push it to your group's fork as well. We encourage your to do it in order to keep overall track of all of your group's solutions by keeping them in one place. At the same time, all course participants can look into different forks - this is supposed to elicit discussions about assignments, we hope you would use this opportunity to learn about different solutions, interpretations.

#### Changing a group

If you change your group, let us know whether you are joining a different group or working on your own. Your group membership on Canvas has to be adjusted as well.


#### How do we expect our students to work in the group?

The general idea is that members in each group would communicate as follows:

- First, try to solve the questions individually by writing out your own solutions in your individual `.ipynb` files for the corresponding assignment.
- Then, meet online in Zoom as a group with some points for discussion prepared based on your individual work.
- Let also others try to solve the question first on their own.
- If you don't understand a question, or you if you encounter an error, discuss it with other members.
- *Important*: if you need clarification from the teachers, write your questions to the general Canvas discussion topic for Lab N rather than sending us individual emails. This is to ensure that if we provide additional information about the assignments, the information will be available for everyone. Also, if you use Discord, write your question in the course chat - others could have similar problem as you and it would be helpful for them to see the discussion.
- There might be more than one solution for each question.
