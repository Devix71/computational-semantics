If we only sampled from a few chosen Wikipedia articles, the knowledge might not be as easily generalizable. On the other hand, this also mean that we are adding a lot of very specific vocabulary items, such as technical terms relating to various obscure subjects, and that might result in an unnecessary large vocabulary with lots of low-frequency words (this could be solved by excluding the least common words from the vocabulary, which we considered but didn't have time to implement).\n"
