# Working with Github

  - Getting ready
    - If you don't have `git` on your computer, [install it](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
     - [Set up a GitHub account](https://github.com/) if you don't have one yet.
     - Setup [terminal access with an ssh key](https://github.com/settings/keys)to access Github from your computer.
  - To start, one member of the group should create a new private repository which you can use for all your assignments. You can initialise it with a `README.md`.
Under Settings / Manage add all your group members as collaborators as well as teachers: `adamlek`, `nilinykh` and `sdobnik`.
  - Create a folder for the assignment as described above and first save there our version of the assignment.
  - Before changing this file make the first commit and label it like `Original assignment 1. This will allow us to compare your modifications to our files
For sharing individual initial solutions create a subfolder for each member of the group where they can put their versions to share with others.
  - Indicate in the commit message the versions submitted on Canvas so that the two can be linked.
  - You might get conflicts when pulling Jupyter notebooks because different versions modify header information with a version number. This is unfortunate and you should resolve them before proceeding. You do this by opening the file in a text editor and then removing one of the alternative sections that are marked in text. Here it normally works to choose the newest version of the text to resolve the conflict and hope that the notebook still works afterwards.
